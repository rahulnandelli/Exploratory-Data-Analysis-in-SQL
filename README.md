# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) SQL script** that helps analyze datasets using SQL queries. The script performs various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization tasks to extract meaningful insights.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `Exploratory Data Analysis.sql` - SQL script for performing EDA.

## 📊 Features
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Aggregation and grouping
- Trend analysis using SQL queries

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
To run this SQL script, you need:
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-supported platform.
- **Dataset**: Ensure you have a dataset loaded into your database.

## 🚀 How to Use

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or a cloud-based SQL editor).
3. Import your dataset into the database.
4. Execute `Exploratory Data Analysis.sql` in your SQL environment.
5. Analyze the output and modify queries as needed.

## 📝 Example Queries
```sql
-- Checking for missing values
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) AS missing_count 
FROM your_table
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

-- Finding the most frequent values in a column
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
